## Commands
* `$@` refers to all of a shell scriptâ€™s command-line arguments. (Similar to `args[]` in java). 
Usage:
`./test.sh foo bar`
```shell script
# inside test.sh
some_var $@   # will store "foo" and "bar" in some_var 
```
* `$<`
* `S`


### Curl 
* flags
 -s => `--silent` option. It doesn't show progress bar with this flag
 -L => (HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page has a different location (indicated with the header line Location:) this flag will let curl attempt to reattempt the get on the new place. 
 -o => `--output <file>`. It writes output to file instead of stdout
 
### `Crontab` for running cron jobs
```sh

## Makefile

#### Syntax:
A Makefile consists of a set of rules. A rule generally looks like this:
```sh
targets : prerequisities
   command
   command
   command
```
   - The targets are file names, seperated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.
   - The commands are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to start with a tab character, not spaces.
   - The prerequisites are also file names, seperated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run.

* Automatic variables in Makefile
    `$@` : evaluates to target
    `$<` : evaluates to 1st prerequisite (usually a source file in the command)
